# digit-recognizer
This is a ML based digit recognizer. Till now, three ML techniques have been used for this which are

* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

Among these, CNN showed best performance with accuracy of 99%.

## Dataset
It is assumed that you already have the train and test data set. If not, you can obtain it easily from internet since it's a pretty famous dataset.

## Future
I will be trying more advanced techniques to improve the result.
